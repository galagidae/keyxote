# Keyxote
Keyxote (/kiːˈhoʊteɪ/) is a virtual keyboard app designed for android users with low vision.

## Background
The Android screen magnifier does not magnify the on-screen virtual keyboard. This makes it extraordinarily difficult for low-vision users to type accurately without relying heavily on TalkBack.

Keyxote attempts to remedy this by providing a large-format keyboard that is easy to see.
